# cg-angular-sample

A customer has requested a web application based on Angular which can store students details (name, marks) while deciding the grade according to the score which student has gained. You are not expected to write backend calls for this application but proper data structures should be used to handle data. A boilerplate has been provided with a set of test cases. There is a bug in the boilerplate therefore it will not build. You are expected to fix the bug and complete the tasks by fulfilling the requirements and the test cases. Start by creating a new branch and once you are completed, push the code into the newly created branch.

### Tasks to be completed

- [ ] Fix the bug and build the project
- [ ] Find a suitable data structure to store student details
- [ ] Insert data into the selected data structure with proper validation
- [ ] Implement the needed sorting function

- [ ] Change the color of the add button in leaderboard to green using bootstrap classes
